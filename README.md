# AI-Powered Amount Detection in Medical Documents

An intelligent system that automatically extracts and classifies monetary amounts from medical bills, receipts, and healthcare documents using OCR technology and AI-enhanced processing.

## Api Testing Video: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1X8aIQ2nO4cvkW9cLr2aU5KDUrPv0QuTI/view?usp=drive_link

## Problem Statement:

Design a service that extracts financial amounts from medical bills or receipts (typed or scanned, possibly crumpled or partially visible). Interns must handle OCR errors, digit corrections, classification by context, and produce final structured JSON with provenance.


## 🚀 Overview

This project provides a sophisticated pipeline for detecting and categorizing financial amounts in medical documents. It combines traditional OCR with AI-powered classification to accurately identify different types of medical expenses like consultation fees, medicine costs, lab tests, and procedure charges.

### Key Features

- **Multi-format Support**: Process both text/json input and image uploads (JPEG, PNG, BMP)
- **Dual Processing Modes**: Choose between fast rule-based processing or AI-enhanced analysis
- **Smart Classification**: Automatically categorizes amounts into medical expense types
- **Currency Detection**: Supports multiple currencies (INR, USD, EUR, GBP)
- **RESTful API**: Fully documented endpoints for easy integration
- **Modern Web Interface**: React-based frontend with real-time processing visualization

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

### Backend
- **Node.js & Express** - Server runtime and API framework
- **Tesseract.js** - OCR for text extraction from images
- **Google Gemini AI** - AI-enhanced processing and validation
- **Multer** - File upload handling

### Frontend
- **React** - Modern UI framework
- **Tailwind CSS** - Styling and responsive design

## 📦 Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn package manager
- Google Gemini API key (for AI-enhanced mode)

### Backend Setup
```bash
cd backend
npm install

# Set environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Add your GEMINI_API_KEY to .env

# Start development server
npm run dev

```
## Environment Variables

Create a .env file in the backend directory:
```bash
PORT=3000
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
GEMINI_MODEL=your_gemini-model
```
### Frontend Setup
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

##  Usage

- **Fast Mode 🚀** :  Rule-based processing for quick results

- **AI Enhanced Mode 🤖** :  Gemini AI-powered analysis for higher accuracy

## Storage
Currently, images are processed in-memory for simplicity. In a production-ready setup, I would extend this to use either diskStorage (local uploads folder) or a cloud provider like Cloudinary/S3 for persistence and scalability.
